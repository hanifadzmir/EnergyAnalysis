    "A utility company invested 50 million dollars to build a new generator that can generate 100 GWh of electricity per year to serve 1,000 consumers. The generator has a fixed production cost of $50/MWh and has a projected lifespan of 20 years. Apart from the generator, the utility also has a fixed 10 million dollars maintainance cost corresponding to this generator and the associated distribution grids to ensure service reliability.
